# Video What is business ethics

## What is the difference between general and business ethics? (5-7 sentences)

General ethics represents the basic moral ground rules by which we live our lives, and concerns right and wrong behavior with a preference for choosing the right action. Business ethics, in contrast, refers to standards and practices in the workplace setting, including social, business, and legal standards. The main difference is that business ethics is often more rigid and less flexible than personal ethics. For example, you might be late for a personal appointment, but being late for work is a violation of professional standards. While personal morality can be subjective, ethics in the workplace are clearly defined by the employer and are not subject to personal choice. Thus, the shift from personal ethics to professional ethics requires a change in perspective and the adoption of a professional outlook that expects unbiased and respectful behavior.

# File: Work ethics

## page 1 exercise B name 3 the most ethical and 3 the least ethical jobs. Explain your choice in 10-15 sentences

### Most Ethical

1.  Teacher: Focuses on educating and guiding the young; deeply ethical role with little inherent conflict between duty and personal gain.
2.  Nurse : Centered on caring for the sick and vulnerable; bound by a strong code prioritizing patient well-being and health (beneficence).
3.  Police Officer : Mandated to uphold the law and ensure public safety; core ethics demand impartiality and protection of citizens.

### Least Ethical

1.  Car Sales Executive : High-commission environment often incentivizes deceptive practices and lack of transparency to maximize profit.
2.  Estate Agent : Potential for conflict of interest where maximizing personal gain (commission) can lead to misrepresenting property or prioritizing a quick sale over the clients best interest.
3.  Lawyer : Ethical challenges arise when the duty to provide the best possible defense for a client (even a guilty one) prioritizes procedural victory over moral justice.

# page 1 exercise C - name 3 the least ethical doings. Explain your choice in 7-10 sentences

1.  Employing people without the correct paperwork (10): This is highly unethical as it preys on the vulnerable. Workers without legal status often accept extremely low wages and harsh conditions because they have no legal protection, enabling systemic exploitation for profit. This practice also harms the economy by undercutting businesses that comply with fair labor standards.
2.  Selling a defective product (5): This action represents a profound breach of trust and a direct risk to the buyers safety and financial security. Concealing a known defect, such as in a second-hand car, is a form of fraud that prioritizes a quick sale over the consumers well-being. If the defect leads to an accident, the consequences can be catastrophic, potentially causing injury or death.
3.  Using your influence to get jobs for relatives (nepotism) (6): Nepotism is a form of corruption that fundamentally undermines the principles of meritocracy and fairness. By prioritizing family connections over qualifications, a person denies more competent candidates a fair opportunity and can ultimately compromise the performance and integrity of the entire organization. This practice damages morale and leads to resentment among employees who earned their positions through merit.

## page 2 exercise Discussion A (3-5 sentences for each situation)

1. You should appoint the best-qualified female candidate. Discriminating against the superior candidate based on customer bias is unethical and illegal, as it constitutes gender discrimination. While you might temporarily lose sales, hiring a less-qualified man risks poor performance and greater long-term sales loss due to incompetence, not gender. The company must stand by its ethical principles and the principle of meritocracy, gradually challenging customer prejudice through the new managers exceptional results.

2. The companys advertising campaign about ethical behavior creates a direct conflict of integrity. While paying the local market rate is legal, it may not be considered ethical if the wages are insufficient for a decent standard of living. To support the ethical campaign credibly, the company should move toward paying a living wage or invest significantly in local community projects to boost employee well-being. Continuing to advertise "honesty and fairness" without addressing low wages risks being exposed as hypocritical, leading to a massive reputational threat.

3. This is a conflict between loyalty to a friend and professional responsibility to patients. Since the colleague works in a hospital and is making mistakes, the safety of patients must be the absolute priority. You must first talk to your friend and urge her to inform her supervisor or Human Resources immediately to get the necessary support and time off. If she refuses, you have an ethical obligation to report the situation yourself, ensuring she receives help and, most importantly, that no further harm comes to the patients.

# Video How Ethics Can Help You Make Better Decisions

### What is the story behind the speech?:

> The speaker, Michael Schur, recounts an event from 2005 when his wife got into a minor fender bender. The other driver demanded 836 for a tiny scratch. Since this happened during Hurricane Katrina, Schur felt it was wrong to spend money on cosmetic repairs, so he angrily proposed a deal: he would donate the money to hurricane relief if the man let the repair go. Schur rallied his blog followers, who pledged over 25,000 if the man agreed. However, Schur began to feel morally uneasy about shaming the man, which led him to consult philosophers to understand why he felt guilty.

### What were Emmanuel Kants ideas? (2)

> 1.  The Categorical Imperative (Universality): Before acting, you must ask, "What if everyone did what I am about to do?" If the result is a worse world, you must not do it. There are strict rules that cannot be broken.
> 2.  The Formula of Humanity: You must treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means to an end. You cannot use other human beings as tools or "props" to achieve your own goals.

### Aristotels? (1)

> Virtue Ethics: Aristotle believed we should identify specific virtues (like generosity, courage, and friendliness) and practice them. The goal is to achieve the "Golden Mean"—possessing these qualities in the exact right amount (not too little, not too much).

### Utilitarians? (1)

> Consequentialism (Maximizing Happiness): Utilitarians (like Bentham and Mill) focus entirely on the results of an action. Their goal is to maximize pleasure/happiness and minimize pain/suffering. If the total "good" outweighs the "bad," the action is considered moral.

### What was the outcome of a story?

> Schur realized that by using the man as a "prop" for his charity drive, he had violated Kants ethics. He called the man, confessed everything, and apologized sincerely. The man was gracious and forgave him. Schur paid the 836 for the car repair, but the blog followers donated the pledged 25,000 to the Red Cross anyway, resulting in a happy ending.

### What is the main message of a speech?

> Life is filled with "unprepared" moments—messy, difficult moral dilemmas where there is no clear rulebook. Just as we practice for sports or skills, we should study ethics to prepare for these moments. We will inevitably fail sometimes, but the effort to learn and try to be better is what truly matters.
