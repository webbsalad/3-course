## page 1 exercise A - name 3 the most important, 3 the least important and add 3 more, not mentioned in the box

### 3 Most Important Factors:

1. Experience: Having relevant work history is arguably the most critical factor, as it demonstrates that the candidate already possesses the necessary skills and a proven track record
2. Qualifications: This includes academic degrees, professional certifications, and specialized training, which validate that the candidate has the theoretical knowledge and credentials for the job
3. Personality: A good personality and the ability to be a "cultural fit" are essential, as most jobs require effective collaboration and interaction with others

### 3 Least Important Factors:

1. Astrological sign: This factor has no bearing whatsoever on professional competence or performance and represents a form of non-relevant bias in hiring
2. Blood group: Similar to the astrological sign, a person's blood group is completely irrelevant to their qualifications, character, or ability to perform the job duties
3. Handwriting: In today's digitally focused world, handwriting is rarely important unless the job specifically requires it, and generally does not reflect a candidate's core job skills

### 3 Missing Important Factors:

1.  Technical Skills: Specific, measurable skills, such as proficiency in certain software (e.g., Excel, specific coding languages), which directly impact job output.
2.  Problem-Solving Ability: This refers to the capacity to think critically, identify issues, and develop effective solutions, which is a core requirement for success in many roles.
3.  Adaptability/Flexibility: The willingness to learn quickly and adjust to changing work conditions or technology is crucial in the current fast-paced business environment.

## Explain your choice in 5-7 sentences

My choices are based on the premise that employers primarily look for proof that a candidate can do the job and will be a good fit with the existing team. Experience and Qualifications prove the necessary knowledge and history of success Personality indicates team integration. Conversely, factors like Astrological sign, Blood group, and Handwriting have zero correlation with professional competence and should be disregarded. The missing items, such as Technical Skills and Adaptability, reflect the critical need for specific, applicable proficiencies and the ability to manage change in the modern workforce.

### 1a. job

#### Best Job: Golang Developer at Ozon

My best job is my current role as a Golang Developer at Ozon. I genuinely enjoy my work because the company maintains an excellent attitude towards employees. There are many different benefits and a highly competitive salary. What truly makes the difference are my fantastic colleagues and the small but enjoyable perks, like having delicious syrniki available in the office. This positive environment motivates me to perform at my best.

#### Worst Job: Summer at Subway

My worst job was a summer position at Subway when I was 14. For a very low salary, I had to work 12 hours a day, six days a week. The working conditions were poor, and the manager was particularly harsh and unfriendly. This experience taught me the value of fair compensation and a good working environment.


### 2a. interview

#### Best Interview Experience: Ozon

My best interview was for my current role at Ozon. I was interviewed by the future team lead, who turned out to be incredibly kind and friendly. It felt less like a formal interrogation and more like a great conversation between two professionals. We quickly established a good rapport, which was a strong indicator of our future excellent working relationship.

#### Worst Interview Experience: Avito

My worst interview was a technical interview for Avito. It was my very first technical interview, and I was so nervous that I struggled to give coherent answers to the questions. I essentially "talked nonsense" due to the anxiety. I didn't get the job, but it was a crucial learning experience that helped me prepare better for all future technical screenings.
