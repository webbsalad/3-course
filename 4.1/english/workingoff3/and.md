**Top-5 Status Perks in an Organisation**

In my opinion, the five most important perks showing a person's status in a company are: **having a secretary**, **your own office**, **flying business class**, **a company car**, and **taking holidays when you like**.

I give the highest score (5) to **having a secretary** because it clearly indicates that the person's time is too valuable to spend on administrative tasks, which is a major sign of seniority. **Your own office** is also crucial (score 5) as it provides privacy and space, often linked to the need for confidentiality and high-level work. **Flying business class** (score 5) is a direct symbol of the company's investment and respect for the individual's comfort and position. **A company car** (score 4) and **taking holidays when you like** (score 4) are also highly valued as they represent financial power and autonomy, respectively, which are key indicators of high status and trust within the organisation.

**Comparing Company Structures**

There are typically two main ways to organise a company: a **functional (or hierarchical) structure** and a **matrix structure**.

In a functional structure, employees report to one manager and are grouped by specialisation (e.g., Marketing, Sales). This structure is clear and efficient for routine tasks, making decision-making straightforward. However, it can lead to slow communication between departments.

The matrix structure, by contrast, involves employees reporting to two or more managers functional manager and a project manager. The main benefit of this system is **flexibility** and the efficient sharing of knowledge and resources across different projects.

I think the **matrix structure** is better for modern, global businesses. Although it can cause confusion about who to report to, its strength lies in promoting **cooperation** and innovation, which are essential for tackling complex, cross-functional projects.
