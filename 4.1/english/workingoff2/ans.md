# Video How to create a great brand name?

### 1. What are the 3 essential steps when creating a successful brand?

1.  **Select the Type of Name:** Decide which of the seven categories your brand name will fall into.
2.  **Define the Big Idea:** The name must stand for a big idea that translates into emotional appeal, rather than merely describing what the company does.
3.  **Check Availability and Meaning:** Ensure the name is not already taken and does not have any negative meaning in other languages or countries.
