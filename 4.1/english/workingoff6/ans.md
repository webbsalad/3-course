> I agree with this result because my approach focuses on self-improvement rather than rivalry. I genuinely believe its more important to take part than to win. I try not to compare my achievements to those of others; instead, I aim to compare my current self with my past self to track personal growth. I enjoy and perform better when working in a group where collaboration is key. Moreover, I make an effort to avoid pressure and overly stressful competitive situations as much as possible. This preference for internal development and cooperation perfectly aligns with the description of being "not very competitive."

### D:

1a. Yes, I recently spent a week developing a feature based on a requirement I thought I understood perfectly. Then, the product manager told me I had completely missed the point of the task. All my hard work was wasted, and it felt like flogging a dead horse from the start.

1b. I sometimes feel like Im flogging a dead horse when I try to reduce my sleeping hours. No matter how hard I try to wake up earlier, my body always demands more sleep, so I just accept that I need to rest a lot.

2. I believe the company Chernogolovka is now ahead of the game in the soft drinks market, at least regarding local preferences. Many consumers feel that their products taste better than Coca-Colas, giving them a significant edge in capturing market share.

3a. When someone moves the goalposts, I feel extremely frustrated and demotivated. It makes it impossible to plan properly because just when you think youve succeeded, the rules change again.

3b. When I am put in the driving seat on academic or work projects, I feel a huge sense of responsibility and motivation. This leadership role compels me to organize everything efficiently and ensures I am completely focused on delivering a successful outcome.

## summarize the theory given in the video

> The video explains the Marketing Mix, which is a combination of four crucial elements, known as the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place

## choose the product and identify its 4 Ps, give your reasons (7-10 sentences)

The product chosen is the Apple MacBook Pro.

Product: The MacBook Pro is a premium, high-performance laptop. It features a durable aluminum chassis, a Retina display, and runs on the integrated macOS with Apple M-series chips.

Price: The price is consistently high (premium segment, starting from $1500+), reflecting the brands status and exclusive technology. Apple rarely offers discounts, which maintains its image as a luxury product.

Promotion: Marketing is minimalist and emotional. Advertising focuses on professional creativity and the superior user experience, often utilizing high-profile keynote events to showcase product innovation.

Place: Sales channels are strictly controlled. Distribution primarily occurs through proprietary Apple Stores, the official Apple Online Store, and a limited network of authorized premium resellers, which ensures a high standard of service.
