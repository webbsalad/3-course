# Video 10 things I learned after losing a lot of money

### What happened to the lady? (sum up her life story)

She quit a well-paid job to work with students but undercharged for her services because she didnt value herself. A sudden tax bill wiped out her savings, leaving her with less than €4 and unable to buy her daughter a birthday cake. She decided to expose her failure publicly, launched a "money project," wrote a book, and became financially stress-free within six months.

### What are 10 things that she discovered?

1. Money is important 
2.  Money doesnt make you a bad person
3.  Money equals time 
4.  Money equals value
5.  What people say doesnt matter 
6.  What you say to yourself matters most 
7.  The rules are simple
8.  Parkinsons Law
9.  Being broke sucks
10. Stay broke

### Choose 3 pieces of advice you enjoyed the most. Why did you like them? (мини-текст)

### Выберите 3 совета, которые вам понравились больше всего. Почему?
1.  "Value yourself."
     - Why: I liked this because she explained that treating yourself poorly sets a bad example for others (like her daughter) and that self-worth is directly linked to financial worth.
2.  "Limit access to your money" 
     - Why: This is very practical. She admits she spends like a 12-year-old, so she moves money to accounts she cannot touch immediately. It’s a smart way to trick your own brain into saving.
3.  "Stay broke" 
     - Why: I enjoyed this paradox. Even after making money, she chose to live simply because she realized that expensive things dont bring happiness—time and freedom do.
